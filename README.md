# NFT Collection Manager

This repository contains a JavaScript project that provides a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection manager. It allows users to create and store their NFTs along with their metadata in a convenient way. The project consists of three main functionalities:



## Features

- NFT Collection Variable:
  
A variable named nftCollection has been created to hold a collection of NFTs. This is implemented as an array, allowing users to store multiple NFTs in a single data structure.

- Mint NFT Function:

The mintNFT function allows users to create an NFT and its metadata. When calling this function, users can pass parameters to define the metadata values for their NFTs. The minted NFT is then stored in the nftCollection array.

- List NFTs Function:

The listNFTs function enables users to view the metadata of all the NFTs they have created. It displays the metadata for each NFT in the nftCollection array, providing an easy way to inspect the properties of each NFT.

- Get Total Supply Function:

The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs that have been created and stored in the nftCollection. This function helps users keep track of the size of their NFT collection.


## Contributing

This project aims to simplify NFT management by providing basic functionalities to create, store, and view NFTs and their metadata. Users can extend and integrate this codebase into their own NFT-related applications or use it as a starting point for further development.
